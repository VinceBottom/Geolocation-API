# Geolocation-API
###Goal of program is to extract county data using the geopy feature Nominatim when given city names
##If you add a loop, time delay of 7-10 seconds, and a function returning the county, 
##you can use this main sequence to extract the county data for a dataset given the name and state of a city.
##Not recommended for continued use by the package authors.
##Nominatim may offer more complex things as well but this is what was needed for this data project.
