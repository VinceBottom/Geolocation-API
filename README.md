# Geolocation code written in Python
# Goal of the Python code is to search and then enter in county data using the geopy feature Nominatim when given city names. If you add a loop, time delay of 7-10 seconds, and a function returning the county, you can use this main sequence to return the county data for a dataset after entering the city and state. Not recommended for continuous/app-based use by the package authors. Nominatim may offer more complex things as well but this is what was needed for this data project.
